Figure. Evolutionary relationships of taxa
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [1]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 4.86379650 is shown. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method [2] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 240 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 5744 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [3].
