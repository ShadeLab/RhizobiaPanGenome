Figure. Evolutionary relationships of taxa
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [1]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates [2] is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [2]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [2]. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method [3] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 98 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 5747 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [4].
